## Purpose of the Front End for How Are You Doing
Having SOA allows us to use Single Responsibility Principle and keep our application streamlined. It means that if the needs of our app change, we can be more flexible than if we had a monolith. It allows us to create multiple front-ends in the future, such as the possibility of a mobile application to go with this web application. The responsibility of this Front End is to store the user data, make requests to the back end, and then render a view for the user.
## Local Setup for any other use
 - Fork and Clone the repo
 - Install gem packages: `bundle install`
 - Setup the database: `rails db:create`

## Versions
 Ruby 2.7.2
Rails 5.2.6

## OAuth
This application utilizes Google OAuth for login and user profile creation. Utilizing OAuth allows us to have user verification and a more fluid signup process. With the data from Google, we can use information such as email so that friends can only follow users they know. This email requirement offers an added layer of privacy while still allowing for friendship interactions.

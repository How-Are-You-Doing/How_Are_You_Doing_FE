## OAuth
This application utilizes Google OAuth for login and user profile creation. Utilizing OAuth allows us to have user <br>verification and a more fluid signup process. With the data from Google, we can use information such as email so<br> that friends can only follow users they know. This email requirement offers an added layer of privacy while still<br> allowing for friendship interactions. 

## [How Are You Doing - Back End](https://github.com/How-Are-You-Doing/How_Are_You_Doing_BE)
- To see how our Applications Back End Service is built, reveiw all endpoint documentation, see the exteral API's<br> is intigarted into our applications design checkout our [How Are You Doing Back End Repo](https://github.com/How-Are-You-Doing/How_Are_You_Doing_BE)

### Purpose of the Front End for How Are You Doing
Having SOA allows us to use Single Responsibility Principle and keep our application streamlined.<br> It means that if the needs of our app change, we can be more flexible than if we had a monolith. <br> It allows us to create multiple front-ends in the future, such as the possibility of a mobile application to go with this web application. <br> The responsibility of this Front End is to store the user data, make requests to the back end,<br> and then render a view for the user.
